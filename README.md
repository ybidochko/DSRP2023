# DSRP2023
The Purpose of this repository is to serve as a place to host my data science projects and files during the 2023 Data Science Research Program.

I have been using this kaggle dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/powerlifting-benchpress-weight-predict?select=X_train.csv" for my lab assignments. It is a dataset of age, gender, presence of equipment, max deadlift, and max squat.
